## Skill Upgrades

### Wager Maximum

	- After level 5, the price increases with a new formula.
    	- C(n) = (2 * C(n-1) * (n-1)) * .3
			- `C(n)` represents the cost at level `n`.
			- `C` represents previous cost.
		```
		C(4) = 160,000

		C(5) = (2 * C(5-1)  * (5-1)) * .3
		C(5) = (2 * 160,000 * 4)     * .3
		C(5) = (320,000     * 4)     * .3
		C(5) = (1,280,000)           * .3
		C(5) = 384,000

		C(6) = (2 * C(6-1)  * (6-1)) * .3
		C(6) = (2 * 384,000 * 5)     * .3
		C(6) = (768,000     * 5)     * .3
		C(6) = (3,840,000)           * .3
		C(6) = 1,152,000
		```
		- Level 6 cost 384,000 GC, level 7 cost 1,152,000
- Each upgrade increases the maximum wager for various games.
- Coinflip increases by 2x each upgrade.
	- Card War is 25% of your Coinflip Max.

- If default is 2,000, level 1 makes it 4,000, level 2 makes it 8,000, etc.

### Coinflip Consecutive Bonus
- Can be upgraded 10 times.
- Initial cost: 20,000 GC, each upgrade increases price by 20,000 until you hit level 5.
	- After level 5, the formula for price is:
		- `C(n) = (2 * C(n-1) * (n-1)) * .2`
- Each time you level up the skill, you get a 1% increase payout to Coinflip if you consecutively win.
	- Half effiency in Card War.
- If the skill is level 1:
	```
	COUNT    |  PAYOUT
	-------------------
	1x Win   |    2.00x
	2x Win   |    2.01x
	3x Win   |    2.02x
	```

	```

### Claim Multiplier
- Can be upgraded 10 times.
- Initial cost: 30,000 GC, each upgrade increases price by 30,000.
- Each level increases the amount you receive when claiming the free react reward. Reward = ((skill level * 0.5) + 1) * amount.

### Bank Interest
- Can be upgraded 5 times.
- Initial cost: 5M GC, each upgrade costs an additional 5M GC.
- Each upgrade increases the interest you make on your bank by .5% up to 3% weekly, paid out hourly.
